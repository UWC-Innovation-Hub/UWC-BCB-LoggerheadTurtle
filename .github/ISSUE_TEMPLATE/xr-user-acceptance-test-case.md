## User Acceptance Test Scenarios

**Scenario X:**
1. User Task: 
Provide a clear, concise description of what the user needs to accomplish.

2. Business Requirement Reference: 
[e.g., BR-101: Users must be able to manipulate 3D medical models]

3. Success Criteria:
- [e.g., User completes task independently]
- [e.g., User expresses confidence in interaction]
- [e.g., Task completed within 3 minutes]
- [e.g., User correctly identifies key information]

4. User Experience Considerations:
- Comfort: [Notes on physical/mental comfort during this scenario]
- Intuitiveness: [Notes on how intuitive the interaction should be]
- Emotional response: [Expected emotional reaction]

**Post-Experience Questions**
- [e.g., How comfortable was the experience physically?] (1-5 scale)
- [e.g., How easy was it to understand what you needed to do?] (1-5 scale)
- [e.g., What was the most valuable aspect of the experience?] (open-ended)
- [e.g., What was the most confusing or difficult part?] (open-ended)
- [e.g., Would you recommend this experience to others?] (1-5 scale)

**XR-Specific Acceptance Factors**
- Physical comfort: [e.g., No motion sickness, Comfortable for 30+ minutes]
- Spatial understanding: [e.g., Clear understanding of virtual/real boundaries]
- Input naturalness: [e.g., Interactions feel intuitive and responsive]
- Sense of presence: [e.g., Users report feeling immersed in the experience]

**Sign-off Criteria**
Define what constitutes formal acceptance of the XR experience.
