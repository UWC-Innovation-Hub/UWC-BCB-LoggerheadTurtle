**XR System Test Scope**
Define the boundaries of the system being tested (e.g., entire VR training application, AR museum experience).

**Test Objective**
Describe what aspects of the complete XR system you're testing.

**Test Environment**
- XR Platform(s): [e.g., Oculus Quest 2, HoloLens 2, WebXR]
- Framework/Engine: [e.g., Unity, Unreal, Three.js]
- Backend Services: [e.g., Content server, User authentication, Analytics]
- Physical Environment: [e.g., Room-scale, Seated, Multi-room]
- Hardware Accessories: [e.g., Haptic gloves, Trackers]
- Network Conditions: [e.g., Local Wi-Fi, Internet connection]

**Complete XR Experience Flow**
Outline the end-to-end user journey through the XR experience.

**System Test Cases**

**Test Case X: [Brief description of system scenario]**
**User Profile**: [e.g., First-time user, Expert user, Special needs user]

1. Preconditions: 
- [e.g., User account is created]
- [e.g., Environment is prepared for XR use]
- [e.g., Required content is pre-loaded]

2. Test Steps:
Step 1:
Step 2:
Step 3:

3. Expected Results:
- [e.g., User successfully completes onboarding]
- [e.g., All interactive elements function as expected]
- [e.g., Experience progresses through all planned stages]
- [e.g., System performance remains within acceptable parameters]

4. Success Criteria:
- [e.g., Complete user flow in <10 minutes]
- [e.g., Zero tracking losses during critical interactions]
- [e.g., All data correctly saved to backend]

5. XR System Stability Factors
- Continuous usage duration: [e.g., 30 minutes without issues]
- Environmental condition variations: [e.g., Different lighting, room sizes]
- User variation handling: [e.g., Height differences, mobility considerations]
- Device battery performance: [e.g., Battery drain rate, thermal management]

**Subsystem Interactions to Verify**
- [e.g., Tracking system + Content loading system]
- [e.g., User Input + Real-time feedback systems]
- [e.g., Backend communication + Local caching]

**Data Collection & Metrics**
- System performance data to collect: [e.g., Frame rate, Latency, Loading times]
- User interaction data to collect: [e.g., Completion rates, Error frequency]
- How and when data should be captured

**Additional Notes**
Any other relevant information for system testing.
